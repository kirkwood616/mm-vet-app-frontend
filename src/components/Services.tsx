            Annual wellness exams evaluate your pets overall health, detect
            problems before they become serious, and keep them on track to live
            a long, healthy life.

          <br />

          <p>
            <span>
              Your pet can benefit greatly from regular wellness exams or
              checkups. No matter the age, wellness exams provide an excellent
              opportunity for us to conduct a thorough physical exam and develop
              a health profile for your pet. This could help us identify
              problems early and any other issues that may affect your pet’s
              health and quality of life. Preventing an illness is a much more
              desirable option than treating an illness.
            </span>
            <br />

            <p>
              <span>
                A wellness exam includes an evaluation of all of your pet’s
                major organ systems. We’ll use the wellness visit to ask you
                questions about your pet’s behavior, appetite, exercise habits
                and regular activities at home.
              </span>
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              <span>
                A wellness exam is also your chance to have us address your
                questions or concerns about your pet. We welcome your questions.
                No question is too small or too silly, and it is our pleasure to
                address your concerns. We strive to help you understand your
                pet’s health care and be involved in decision making.
              </span>
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Finally, wellness exams help us establish a relationship with you
              and your pet. Through your pet’s physical exams, other wellness
              procedures and our consultations with you, we get to know your pet
              and learn about his or her lifestyle, personality, health risks,
              home environment and other important information. We encourage you
              to use wellness exams to take an active role in your pet’s health
              care. Your pet’s health is always our number one priority, which
              is why for most pets we recommend annual wellness exams to ensure
              that your animal companion remains in good health. If your pet is
              a senior–over seven for dogs, over nine for cats–we strongly
              suggest twice-yearly exams and blood screenings. That’s because
              pets age more rapidly than humans, meaning disease and illness
              develop faster as well.

            Imagine if you never brushed your teeth or had them cleaned. Pretty
            frightening, right? As you can imagine, things would eventually
            start to go very, very bad inside your mouth: teeth would rot and
            decay, gums would become inflamed and infected. Bacteria from those
            rotting teeth would eventually travel into your bloodstream and
            could cause other serious health problems. And we haven’t even
            mentioned the daily, debilitating pain. It’s the same scenario for
            your dog or cat. While some people might laugh at the idea of
            brushing their pet’s teeth or taking them for a dental cleaning, the
            fact is that by age three, 80% of dogs and 70% of cats have some
            evidence of periodontal disease. Periodic dental exams help maintain
            proper oral hygiene and prevent future problems.

          <img src="./animal-photos/diet.jpg" alt="diet-nutrition-services" />
          <p>
            Proper diet and nutrition can help your pet fight against disease,
            maintain a proper weight, and promote the overall well-being of your
            pet.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Maintaining a healthy body weight is a very important aspect of a
            pet’s overall physical health. Good nutrition can help provide your
            pet with a happier, safer, and longer life. There are many
            nutritional supplements that can help fight against disease,
            maintain a proper weight, and promote the overall well-being of any
            animal.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Why is maintaining a healthy weight important?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Obesity is a common problem among pets, as it can be easy to
            overfeed a pet that knows how to beg. Being overweight is a serious
            problem for animals, and can cause health problems as they get
            older. With proper diet and exercise, all pets should be able to
            meet their dietary needs and be within a healthy weight range. The
            best way to make sure your pet’s needs are being met is to consult
            with us about a specific diet for your pet and their lifestyle. Our
            staff will help your pet battle unhealthy weight gain and counsel
            you on the best nutritional options available.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>When is a diet change needed?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Pets should be fed a balanced wellness diet based on a number of
            factors, including their life stage, their breed or size, activity
            level, and any health issues they have. Diet changes are recommended
            when they enter a new life stage. For example, transitioning is
            recommended from puppy or kitten to adult, or from adult to senior,
            which is usually around age seven. Diet changes may also be
            recommended if your pet develops any issues that could be treated
            with a prescription diet, such as obesity or a food allergy.
          </p>
          <br />

              We will help you make the right dietary changes for your pet so
              that they can stay on track living their happy and healthy lives.
              A healthy diet and good nutrition can reduce or even eliminate the
              following problems:
            </ul>
            <li>pet allergies</li>
            <li>itching and scratching</li>
            <li>dull coat</li>
            <li>arthritis</li>
            <li>joint and hip problems</li>
            <li>intestinal disorders</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              Skin and coat supplements are a great way to keep your pet looking
              and feeling their best. Arthritis and joint supplements can be
              helpful for many pets as they age.

          <p>
            Young animals are like kids—it’s a never-ending job to keep them
            safe and happy. Vaccinating your pet is a relatively inexpensive but
            very important way to protect his or her health. In addition to
            preventing many life-threatening illnesses, vaccinations can prevent
            diseases prevalent in wildlife and those that can be passed to
            humans. It’s important to administer vaccinations when pets are
            puppies and kittens because their young immune systems are still
            developing and need protection to stay healthy.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            While any medical treatment involves some degree of risk, in the
            case of vaccinations, the benefits far outweigh any potential side
            effects. Adverse reactions are rare and usually mild and short-term
            when they do occur.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div>
            <ul>
              Which vaccines should your pet have? “Core” vaccines are those
              recommended—and possibly mandated by law—for most pets. Core
              vaccines include:
            </ul>
            <li>Rabies (dogs and cats)</li>
            <li>
              DA2PPV – Distemper, Hepatitis, Adenovirus 2, Parvo and
              Parainfluenza (dogs)
            </li>
            <li>
              FVRCP – Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis, Calicivirus and
              Panleukopenia (cats)
            </li>
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            Other non-core, but highly suggested vaccinations for cats include
            FIV for feline immunodeficiency virus and FeLV to protect against
            feline leukemia. For dogs, bordetella and canine influenza
            vaccinations are recommended if they frequent dog parks, boarding
            kennels, or any place where they’re socializing with other canines.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It’s also important to note that even pets who live primarily
            indoors should be vaccinated, as they can still be exposed to a
            disease. Your M&M Veterinary Clinic veterinarian can advise you
            which vaccinations are required or recommended for your pet based on
            age, health, and lifestyle. For more information or to schedule an
            appointment, call us at(555)555-5555.

            Spaying or neutering your pet can help them live a longer, healthier

            unwanted dogs and cats.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, nearly
            12,500 puppies are born in the United States each hour. Spaying
            females or castrating males eliminates unwanted litters, which
            contribute to thousands of euthanasia procedures and millions of
            stray animals. Additionally, these procedures can minimize behavior
            problems and help your pet live a longer, healthier life by reducing
            the likelihood of certain cancers and tumors.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>When should I have my pet spayed or neutered?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            In general, we recommend spaying or castrating small dogs and cats
            between 4-6 months of age. With large breed dogs, we often recommend
            delaying the surgery until they are 6-12 months of age.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Why should I have my pet spayed or neutered?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            There are many benefits that come with spaying your female companion
            animal. They include helping to control the stray dog and cat
            population, eliminating the sometimes 'messy' heat cycles that
            attract male dogs, and preventing diseases in your pet such as
            pyometra (infection in the uterus) and mammary cancer. Additionally,
            research has shown that spayed pets live longer than pets that have
            not been spayed.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            There are also many benefits that come with castrating your male
            companion animal. These benefits include helping to control the
            stray dog and cat population, eliminating undesirable and
            embarrassing behavior, and preventing diseases in your pet such as
            prostate disease and testicular cancer.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>How is a spay or neutering surgery performed?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Spaying, also called an "ovariohysterectomy," is a surgical
            procedure in which both ovaries and uterus are completely removed
            from your female pet while they are under general anesthesia.
            Castrating refers to the surgical procedure in which both testicles
            are removed while your male pet is under general anesthesia.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Before the operation, we will assess your pet to minimize risk.
            While your pet is under anesthesia we take individual care for the
            safety of each pet. Our certified technicians and doctors are
            trained in advanced monitoring to ensure your pet's comfort.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Your pet’s safety and comfort are our primary concerns when
            performing a spay or castration. We routinely use a IV catheter and
            fluids on canine spays and castrations, as well as feline spays.
            This is important for maintaining blood pressure and perfusion to
            the kidneys and other organs as well as allowing immediate IV access
            in the event of an emergency. We use advanced pain management
            techniques in conjunction with anesthesia to make sure your pet is
            as comfortable as possible during the procedure and after they are
            discharged. Our spay and castration patients receive 2 or 3
            different injectable pain medications during the procedure and
            usually go home with oral pain medication. We also perform local
            anesthetic blocks at the surgical site. Proper pain management makes
            the procedure as comfortable as possible and allows for faster
            recovery.

          <h1>Parasite Control</h1>
          <h2>(Fleas, Ticks & Heartworms)</h2>
          <img src="./animal-photos/parasite-control-ser.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Parasites such as fleas and ticks can be very damaging to your pet’s
            health. Preventive measures should be taken year-round to inhibit
            potential outbreaks.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The idea of your pet being infested with parasites is a disturbing
            thought, but it’s also a medical issue that can have serious
            consequences. Parasites can diminish quality of life and even cause
            life-threatening health issues.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Common internal parasites include heartworms, roundworms, hookworms,
            whipworms and tapeworms. The most frequent external parasites
            include fleas and ticks. Your pet should be free from parasites,
            both internal and external.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Why are parasites dangerous?</h3>
          <h4>Fleas:</h4>
          <p>
            Fleas are small, wingless, brown, fast moving insects you can see in
            your pet’s fur. Some animals are allergic to the saliva of fleas,
            which can cause inflammation and more discomfort. If ingested while
            your pet is grooming themselves, fleas can transmit an intestinal
            parasite called tapeworm. Flea infestations can lead to anemia and
            fleas are also capable of transmitting serious diseases.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Ticks:</h4>
          <p>
            Ticks are members of the spider family and live in cracks and
            crevices in the home or outside in vegetation such as grassy
            meadows, woods, brush, and weeds. Some tick bites only cause mild
            irritation or swelling at the site, but other tick bites can infect
            your pet with serious illnesses. If left untreated, these diseases,
            such as lyme, can lead to more severe health problems or even be
            fatal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: If you see a tick and cannot remove it, we will gladly help
            you. Call us immediately to limit the impact of the tick's
            attachment. It’s much safer to have one of our trained professionals
            remove the tick for you. Make an appointment with us immediately to
            limit the impact of the tick.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Heartworm Disease:</h4>
          <p>
            Heartworms are transmitted when an infected mosquito bites your pet.
            Heartworms are parasites that live in the heart and its surrounding
            blood vessels. The adult heartworm produces offspring called
            microfilariae, which circulate in the pet’s blood. Unrecognized and
            untreated heartworm infections can be fatal.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>When should I seek treatment for parasites?</h3>
          <img

            alt="treatment-for-parasites-service"
          />
          <br />
          <h4>Fleas:</h4>
          <p>
            If your pet is showing signs of fleas such as continuous scratching,
            gnawing or licking, schedule an appointment immediately.
            Additionally, flea dirt, the byproduct of fleas that looks like
            coffee grounds or pepper, can usually be seen by looking at your
            pet’s abdomen or by combing your pet’s coat with a fine-tooth comb.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Ticks</h4>
          <p>
            If you see a tick on your pet, do not try and burn it off with a
            match. This does not work and could harm your pet. It’s much safer
            to have one of our trained professionals remove the tick for you.
            Make an appointment with us immediately to limit the impact of the
            tick.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Heartworm Disease:</h4>
          <p>
            The best treatment for heartworms is prevention. One of the most
            common and effective prevention methods is a monthly oral
            medication.
          </p>
          <p>
            The parasite is transmitted through mosquito bites and usually the
            pet shows no signs for months. Later symptoms include difficulty
            breathing, coughing, weight loss, tiring easily and listlessness. In
            many cases pets do not show outward signs until advanced stages of
            the disease. An annual blood test is recommended to screen for
            heartworms. This disease can be treated if found early, but it can
            be costly.
          </p>

          <h3>How can I prevent parasites?</h3>
          <p>
            Our veterinary team is happy to help you choose the correct
            preventive regimen based on your pet’s risk factors and health
            status. It is important to discuss with us yearly which pest control
            products are ideal for your household based on the everyday life of
            your pet.

            Microchip identification is the most reliable way to reunite lost
            pets with their owners.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Microchip identification helps return an estimated 8,000 lost cats,
            dogs, and other animals to their homes every day. Pet ID chips are
            the most reliable way to reunite pets with their owners and provide
            peace of mind.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Why should I microchip my pet?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Microchip identification is the most reliable way to find lost pets
            and return them home with their owners. The procedure is safe, easy,
            and inexpensive.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>When should I microchip my pet?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Some owners feel that their pet doesn't need identification because
            they stay indoors, but in our experience, these are the most likely
            to become lost when they accidentally get outside. As separation
            from your cat or dog can happen all too easily, permanent
            identification by microchipping is critical. Every pet should have
            microchip identification as the procedure can be done at any age.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>How does microchipping work?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The small microchip (the size of a grain of rice) is injected under
            the skin between the shoulder blades of your pet in a relatively
            harmless veterinary procedure. The chip is permanent, lasting the
            whole life of the pet. Your information has to be registered with
            your bar code number so that you can be contacted if your pet ever
            becomes lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a pet is found, all animal care facilities (shelters, hospitals,
            etc.) will scan the pet for a microchip using a special microchip
            reader that is simply waved over the skin. Once a microchip is
            found, a special hotline is called, and the lost pet is reported.
            The pet owner is then called immediately and given the contact
            information about where to pick up their pet.

            We offer the finest in all breed grooming services for your pet. Our
            groomers are experienced, kind, and hard-working! Let us pamper your
            pet and make them look their best. We are happy to employ
            professional groomers in our hospital because we believe that it
            offers many conveniences to you as a client. Two main points would
            be that you can have your pet’s preventive healthcare updated the
            same day as grooming and most importantly, sometimes the groomer is
            the one to first notice ear infections, cysts, tumors, and skin
            conditions which can be early signs of other more serious medical
            conditions.
