            Two main points would be that you can have your petâ€™s preventive
            healthcare updated the same day as grooming and most importantly,
            sometimes the groomer is the one to first notice ear infections,
            cysts, tumors, and skin conditions which can be early signs of other
            more serious medical conditions.
