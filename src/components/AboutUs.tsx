      <h2>OUR DOCTOR</h2>
      <h3>Doctor ipsum</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…? We're trying to defeat the
        Daleks, not start a jumble sale! We are always in trouble! Isn't it
        extraordinary—it follows us everywhere. I am the Doctor! The original,
        you might say! My ship…my TARDIS… As we learn about each other, so we
        learn about ourselves. Our lives are important—at least to us—as we see,
        so we learn…Our destiny is in the stars , so let's go and search for it.
        You don't understand so you find excuses. Alright? Of course I'm
        alright, my child. You know, I am so constantly outwitting the
        opposition, I tend to forget the delights and satisfaction of the gentle
        art of fisticuffs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right! So stop dilly-dallying, and cross it! So these are my
        replacements. A dandy and a clown. One day, I shall come back. Yes, I
        shall come back. Until then, there must be no regrets, no tears, no
        anxieties. Just go forward in all your beliefs and prove to me that I am
        not mistaken in mine. Goodbye Susan. Goodbye my dear. Eh? Doctor who?
        What's he talking about…? You don't understand so you find excuses. As
        we learn about each other, so we learn about ourselves. It all started
        out as a mild curiosity in the junkyard, and now it's turned out to be
        quite a great spirit of adventure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am the Doctor! The original, you might say! Your ideas are too narrow
        and crippled. I am a citizen of the universe and a gentleman to boot.
        Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…? So these are my replacements.
        A dandy and a clown. One day, I shall come back. Yes, I shall come back.
        Until then, there must be no regrets, no tears, no anxieties. Just go
        forward in all your beliefs and prove to me that I am not mistaken in

        You may disguise your features but you can never disguise your intent.
        This thing is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside. There's
        always something to look at if you open your eyes! That's the trouble
        with regeneration. You quite never know what you're going to get. Like
        Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast. Sorry,
        must dash! That could blow a hole in the space-time continuum, the size
        of—actually, the exact size of Belgium. That's a bit undramatic, isn't
        it? 'Belgium'?
      </p>
      <p>
        Safety precaution. I'm allergic to certain gases in the praxis range of
        the spectrum. If the gas is present, the celery turns purple… I eat the
        celery. If nothing else, I'm sure it's good for my teeth. Well, it
        wouldn't be cricket. Sorry, must dash! Brave heart, Tegan. You know how
        it is; you put things off for a day and next thing you know, it's a
        hundred years later. Dreams are important…never underestimate them. It's
        times like this I wish I still had my scarf. Adric? You may disguise
        your features but you can never disguise your intent.

      <h3>Dr.Ipsum too</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that? They're scientific
        instruments, not water pistols. Are you capable of speaking without
        flapping your hands about? 'Timey' what? 'Timey wimey'? I don't suppose
        we'll ever know if we actually succeeded. But at worst, we failed doing
        the right thing, as opposed to succeeding in doing the wrong. Go and be
        the Doctor that I could never be. Do you have to talk like children?
        What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown-up? Then, all
        things considered...it's time I grew up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shall we ask for a better quality of door so we can escape? Doctor no
        more. And in that battle there was a man with more blood on his hands
        than any other. A man who would commit a crime that would silence the
        universe. And that man was me. Why are you pointing your screwdrivers
        like that? They're scientific instruments, not water pistols. Oh, the
        pointing again! They're screwdrivers! What are you going to do? Assemble
        a cabinet at them? Well, who are you boys? Oh, of course! Are you his
        companions?
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Doctor Also Ipsum</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        You may be a doctor. But I'm the Doctor. The definite article, you might
        say. Are you listening to me? What?! Come out. And don't touch anything!
        You're a clumsy, ham fisted idiot! It seems you have a very large rat
        Brigadier—maybe you should employ the services of a very large cat? Have
        a jelly baby. You're standing on my scarf. Well, of course I'm being
        childish! There's no point being grown-up if you can't be childish
        sometimes. The trouble with computers, of course, is that they're very
        sophisticated idiots. They do exactly what you tell them at amazing
        speed. Even if you order them to kill you. So if you do happen to change
        your mind, it's very difficult to stop them from obeying the original
        order. But not impossible.

      <h3>Vet Tech Ipsum</h3>
      <p>
        People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect...
        but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more
        like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. I don't want
        to go. There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people
        fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they
        lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My
        friends. Even that sky. You can spend the rest of your life with me, but
        I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone.
        That's the curse of the Time Lords.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. Oh, yes. Harmless
        is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound,
        doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at
        opening doors! Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete
        history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her
        mother! You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look
        up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the
        caption'll read 'Over my dead body'.
